# Scripts

## Focusmate

### focusmate-outlook-button

Adds a button to [Focusmate](https://focusmate.com/?fmreferral=hU3qiGqRem) sessions to get a one-click outlook calendar invitation.

In versions 0.x, this script is a work in progress and does not yet work.

## Todoist

### todoist-copy-task-comments

This script adds a button to [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com) tasks allowing you to copy all the comments on the task to your clipboard with a single click.

In v1.0, this only works when the task is first opened. If you navigate between tasks, the button will only show for the first task. The workaround for this is to navigate to the task you want, open it, then refresh the page.
